pyfprint
========

This is a python module with CFFI bindings for [libfprint](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fprint/libfprint/)

It's forked from [@luksan](https://github.com/luksan) [original work](https://github.com/luksan/pyfprint), 
which was then improved by [@xantares](https://github.com/xantares) [here](https://github.com/xantares/pyfprint) with Python 3 support.

I've cut off some things, but my use case works and I hope it's useful for somebody :D
